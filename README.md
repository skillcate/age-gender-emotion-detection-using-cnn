# Age, Gender & Emotion Detection Project using CNN | Keras Deep Learning
* In this end-to-end Deep Learnining Project, we are building a Computer Vision based Customer Profiling Model for a Retail Store Client
* Business use case is to predict: Age, Gender & Emotion for customers entering the Retail Store (just like [Amazon Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrmMk1Myrxc) Stores)
* And, itâ€™s actually three projects in one, wherein we have built three separate models, one each on Age, Gender & Emotion Detection.

## How to get training dataset for Age Detection Model Training
* Kaggle dataset [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skillcate/merged-augmented-utk-faces-facial-age-dataset) for download [size ~6GB]
* There are couple of ZIP files you would need to download and keep in this ```./1.1_age_input_output/input``` directory:
  * ```combined_faces_train_augmented.zip```
  * ```combined_faces.zip```
* In case you are working on Google Colab, refer to [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vdC1BEW-PEm43FsCW2LMHbJGxLyLBzyV?usp=sharing) Google Drive folder for Profiles files
* More details [here](https://github.com/skillcate/age-detection-cnn-model/blob/6abe17a0636332fe8d681c4b1ece401539a0765a/1.1_age_input_output/input/For_AgeDetection_Dataset.txt)

There are couple of ZIP files you would need to download and keep in this ./1.1_age_input_output/input directory:
1. combined_faces_train_augmented.zip
2. combined_faces.zip

Kaggle link for these two files: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skillcate/merged-augmented-utk-faces-facial-age-dataset

Dataset details:
1. We combine our original datasets UTK Faces and Facial Age into one combined dataset of 33,486 images
2. Then we split it up into 70-30 training and test sets
3. Then on the training set of 23,440 images, we do Data Augmentation to inflate it to 10x, viz., 234,400 images, which is: combined_faces_train_augmented.zip
4. Test set remains as is: combined_faces.zip
